This section of the guide explains how to execute a query with or without parameters to retrieve data. The guide is focused on the `query` folder of the project. 

### [POST] Execute Query ID

This header explains that the method to execute a query is a POST request. 

### Arguments

This section explains that no arguments are required to execute a query. However, it is possible to add query parameters to the request. An example of how to add query parameters is provided in the guide. 

### Returns

This section explains that the API returns an `execution_id` for the specified request. 

### Example Request

This section provides an example of how to make a request to execute a query. The example shows the URL to use for the request. 

#### cURL

This section provides an example of how to make a request using cURL. The example shows the command to use for the request. 

#### cURL with Parameters

This section provides an example of how to make a request with query parameters using cURL. The example shows the command to use for the request. 

### Example Response
