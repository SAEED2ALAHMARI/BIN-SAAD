description: dex.trades aggregates data across multiple DEX platforms into one simple table.

Decentralized exchanges are the beating heart of the DeFi industry. You can swap any native (ETH) or ERC-20 token for any ERC-20 token through the magic of smart contracts.

The problem here: there are so many decentralized exchanges out there that it's hardly possible for any single person to work with the smart contract data for all of them.

That's why we created [dex.trades](https://dune.com/spellbook#!/model/model.spellbook.dex_trades).

This table standardizes and normalizes the trading data across virtually all relevant decentralized exchanges. This in turn allows you to easily query for trading data for your favorite tokens without having to deal with all of the different DEX smart contracts yourself.

The scripts that generate the table dex.trades can be found in this [public github](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/models/dex) repo.
