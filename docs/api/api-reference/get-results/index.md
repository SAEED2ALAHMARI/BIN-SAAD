Learn how to get query results, including how to check status of an execution and how to get latest associated result. 

<div class="cards grid" markdown>
- [Get Execution Status](../get-results/execution-status.md)
- [Get Execution Results](../get-results/execution-results.md)
- [Get Latest Query Results](../get-results/latest-results.md)
</div>


!!! Tip 
    1. Checking execution status is particularly relevant for you to know the size of the result before you pull it.
    2. If you don't need the most up to date data and just want to query for most recently refreshed results of a query, check out the [get latest results](../get-results/latest-results.md) endpoint.
