title: Latest Query Results
description: Here's how to get the latest results of a query run
---

!!! abstract "ENDPOINTS"
    GET /api/v1/query/{{query_id}}/results
    GET /api/v1/query/{{query_id}}/results/csv

These endpoints allow you to get the latest results of a query, regardless of the job id/run or if it is run in the app or the api. Returns the latest execution id and results of the run. You must pass parameter `query_id`. The query specified must either be public or a query you have ownership of (you or a team you belong to have ownership).

By appending "/csv" to the URL, you specify the return to be in CSV format. Else, results are returned in JSON format.


!!!tip "Note on Parameters"
    - For query params, we recommend you to not have spaces for a parameter, use underscore instead like `https://api.dune.com/api/v1/query/2340912/results?params.LooksRare%20Wash%20Trading%20Filter=ON`. If no query params are provided, the request will fetch the latest results regardless of parameter (not just default!)
    - This endpoint does NOT trigger execution but does consume credits through datapoints

## Example Request

### cURL

```
curl -X GET "https://api.dune.com/api/v1/query/{{query_id}}/results" -H x-dune-api-key:{{api_key}}
```

!!!info
    There is a default 250,000 datapoints limit to make sure you don't accidently spend all your credits in one call. To ignore teh max limit, you can add `ignore_max_datapoints_per_request=true`

    ```
    curl -X GET "https://api.dune.com/api/v1/query/{{query_id}}/results\?ignore_max_datapoints_per_request=true" -H x-dune-api-key:{{api_key}}
    ```

### Python

```Python
import dotenv
import os
import json
import requests
import pandas as pd
import time

api_key = os.environ["DUNE_API_KEY"]

# authentiction with api key
headers = {"x-dune-api-key": api_key}

query_id = 1252207
base_url = f"https://api.dune.com/api/v1/query/{query_id}/results"
params = {
    "params.LooksRare Wash Trading Filter": "ON", # one and only param for this query
}
result_response = requests.request("GET", base_url, headers=headers, params=params)
```

You can partially fill parameters as well, say there are three parameters - if you only pass in two then the other one will use the default parameters:

```
# case 4: partial match of the existing params that were executed will work aka 200
query_id = 1064888
base_url = f"https://api.dune.com/api/v1/query/{query_id}/results"
params = {
    "params.Show Today": "No",
    "params.Time Period": "day" 
    # there is one more param for this query "Trailing Num Periods" which we are not passing
}
result_response = requests.request("GET", base_url, headers=headers, params=params)
```

!!! warning "Parameter 404 Behaviors"
    If a certain parameter has never been run before, i.e. putting in "OFF" above when only "ON" has been executed in app, then you will get a 404. Same thing if you try and use a parameter that doesn't exist on the query.
